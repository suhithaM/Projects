IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project - Overview

In this project we will assume that we have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, our organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements.

We start the project by collecting data using API and webscraping. Webscraping was performed on the URL provided in the course. After collecting the data, the data was studied and followed by data cleaning including finding and removing duplicates from the dataset. Missing values were found and imputed accordingly and finally data normalization was performed to have uniformity in a column which makes data analysis easier.

Proceesing further, exploratory data analysis was performed on the previously cleaned data. Data distribution was analysed, outliers were handled and correlation of columns were also studied and represented as graphs.

The data was visualized using matplotlib and seaborn libraries in python with various charts like histograms, box plots, scatter plots and much more. Finally, IBM Cognos Analytics was used to build dashboards that will compile all of the data and spot trends and insights that might include the following: top programming languages are most in demand today, most in-demand database skills and IDEs that are most popular. 

Lastly, a report was prepared using powerpoint to summarize the findings and discuss the implications of this project.
